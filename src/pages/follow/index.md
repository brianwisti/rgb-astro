Follow the blog, and follow me personally on social networks.

[RSS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS

I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon][] and [Twitter][].  [RSS][] is the best way to follow this site, though.
It works even when my announcement scripts don’t.

[Feedly]: https://feedly.com
[Newsflow]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/newsflow/9nblggh58s5r
[FeedReader]: https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/
[NetNewsWire]: https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/[NetNewsWire]


An RSS file summarizes recent updates on a site. Feed reader apps, such as [Feedly][] (web), [Newsflow][] (Windows),
[FeedReader][] (Linux), or [NetNewsWire][] (macOS), let you subscribe to all the sites you like, letting you read
updates on your own schedule.

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting one of the
below links — the link itself, not the xml file you see if you click the
link — into your feed reader app!

[main feed]: /index.xml
[post feed]: /post/index.xml
[Posts]: /post/
[notes feed]: /notes/index.xml
[notes]: /notes/

The Main Feed
: The [main feed][] includes everything on the site,
  including my experiments with new non-post content types.

The Post Feed
: The [post feed][] is basically the blog. [Posts][] about
  code, craft, and whatever else is on my mind.

The Notes Feed
: The [notes feed][] is for my [notes][]: small posts, informal, more frequent than full blog bosts.
