[book]: https://flaskbook.com/

[Kickstarter]: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1124925856/the-new-and-improved-flask-mega-tutorial/

Miguel Grenberg's[Flask Mega-Tutorial][] and [book][] helped me understand using
Python’s [Flask microframework][]. Well, somewhat. My understanding would
improve if I used it more. Haven’t taken advantage of the opportunity yet.
Anyways - of course I decided to back his [Kickstarter][] for updating the Flask
Mega-Tutorial.

[blog post about the Kickstarter]: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-kickstarter

His [blog post about the Kickstarter][] reminded me that he was doing this. I’m
pushing it here because I know he creates great learning material. Oh and
because I still feel a little bad about sending him so many questions during the
"rough cuts" phase of the Flask book. Further endorsement: he was unfailingly
polite and helpful responding to those questions.
