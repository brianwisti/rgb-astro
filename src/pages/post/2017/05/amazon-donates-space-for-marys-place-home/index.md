My [main hobby project][] is for [Mary's Place][], a local homeless shelter
network in Seattle. It was immensely satisfying to see their director’s face
when I visited Amazon this morning.

Way back when I contracted at Amazon, and their apparent lack of community
engagement at the time annoyed me endlessly. Not only have they improved in that
domain recently, but I approve of at least one organization they focus on
:thumbsup:

From the [Amazon feature][]:

> Mary’s Place announced today that Amazon will donate more than 47,000 sq. ft.
> of space within Amazon’s newest headquarters building as a permanent location
> for a Mary’s Place Family Shelter. This first-of-its-kind partnership will
> include 65 rooms, which will shelter more than 200 homeless women, children,
> and families each night.

Very happy for Mary’s Place. Of course, this just reminds me of all the stuff I
still had on my TODO for that hobby project!
