Follow [@randgeekery][] if Twitter is your news feed.

As of 2020-01-31, I haven’t updated that twitter account in about two years.

This is relevant to my earlier post about [limiting social media][]. See, if
Twitter gets scary enough that I want to lock down my [personal][] account,
I’ll still have this one for sharing posts. Plenty of folks use Twitter as their
news feed. And honestly the way I tweet it’s easy to lose any site-related
content in the GIFs, jokes, and existential despair.

For now the new account exists mainly to be retweeted by me --
and maybe the two friends that found it even though I haven’t posted anything yet.
In the future?
Who knows? I’ve been just [@brianwisti][] for nearly ten years now.
I might enjoy the change of pace.

In the spirit of streamlining, I added a [Follow](/follow/) page for RSS and social media links,
and cleaned up the sidebar links a bit.
