I dunno, folks.
Over the years I have seen so much [outrage][] -- sincere or feigned -- on social media.
Then there’s the [echo chamber][] problem.
Yeah.
Nice thing about an RSS feed is that I’m guaranteed to see everything I subscribe to, but there’s no personal insult in unsubscribing.

I think maybe I could spend less time on Twitter and Facebook.
Not give them up.
They remain a source of great conversation.
But this nonsense takes up brain that I just can’t spare.
Some of my online friends cut themselves out completely, and [they like it][].
Perhaps I should follow their example.

I noticed that the Disqus sections for all post content in 2017 are tied to [my screenshot post][],
which also happens to be the first post content of 2017.
Made some adjustments and had Disqus recrawl the site.

Then I decided that maybe I can do without comments for a while.
