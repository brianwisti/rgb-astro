Took me less than a week. I like that. On the other hand, I established for
certain that when I knit fast my gauge loosens up. The hat fits looser than it
should. I like that less. On the *other* other hand, I already wear it most of
the time. It feels nice.

This pattern came from [Son of Stitch ’n Bitch][].
I used [Patons Astra][] black and — uh — some white yarn of about the right
thickness.


This pattern works for beginners, or someone looking for a break from their big
complicated projects. It might be easier if you knit in the round. There would
be less purling, if nothing else. I may revisit this hat later knitting in the
round, and either knit slower or use smaller needles.
