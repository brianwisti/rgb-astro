Heat a cup of water. Mix in 2 teaspoons argan oil, 1 tablespoon sea
salt, and a few drops of something pretty. Let it cool. Shake before
each use.

### Ingredients

- Sea salt [^1]
- Argan oil [^2]
- Spray bottle [^3]
- Funnel
- Maybe a whisk
- Kettle or other means of making cold water hot

[^1]: Use Dead Sea Celtic Himalayan Pink Salt if makes you happy\!
[^2]: Avocado oil is fine. Olive oil is okay, but use less — it’s thicker
[^3]: Preferably made of glass, since it’s going to hold hot water

### Extras

That’s pretty much all you *need*. You’re free to add more\!

- tea tree, sandalwood, or some other essential oil with a smell that
  pleases you
- hair gel or coconut oil — for additional hold
- epsom salt — for magnesium, I guess?

### Instructions

1. Heat some water in the kettle. If it boils, let it cool a moment.
   You don’t want your first hairspray story to involve burn treatment.
2. Measure out one cup (roughly 250 ml) of hot water
3. Whisk in 2 teaspoons of oil. You can vary this a bit more or less
   depending on how dry your hair gets.
4. Whisk in a tablespoon of sea salt. A little more gives more hold,
   but careful to avoid crusty hair\!
5. If you want your hair to smell nice, whisk in a few drops of essential oil.[^4]
6. Pour your mix into the spray bottle with a funnel, unless you have
   very steady hands\!
7. Let it cool to room temperature or at least until there’s no risk of burns.
8. Shake vigorously before each use\!

[^4]: I tried beard oil once and it added nothing. Too diluted already
      maybe. Use a proper essential oil — or invent your own mix\!

One batch lasts me over a month of daily use, but I intentionally go for
a lighter hold. Out of my face and roughly pointed in the right
direction is all I care about.

## The story

Now that the recipe is out of the way — I thought cookbooks were bad
about forcing you to read a long story before giving you their
instructions. Cookbooks are nothing. Those self-care blogs are *awful*.
An evening searching and I couldn’t find the source for the basic recipe
I’ve been using over the last year or so because I couldn’t get through
all the *stories*.

I had this big story in mind about how I was watching a beard care video
one night and they said "use sea salt spray\! It’s good on your hair\!"
and I said "okay\!" and they said "use *our* sea salt spray\!" and I
said "at that price? H\*ck no\!" I was even going to work in some
[Perl](/tags/perl) references. Talk about how making your own hair spray
is another application of [The Three Virtues](http://threevirtues.com/).

But I got bored just writing the outline for that particular story. Now
it’s a year later, and I’m writing down the recipe somewhere permanent
to avoid losing it again.

Look around for ideas from other recipes, but take what you read with a
grain of sea salt. We’re here for mad science and saving money, not
Clean Living or Purity Of Essence.

Anyways.

This recipe is what I came up with last night after giving up on my
search. You can find many recipes with varying ingredients and
proportions. Experiment. Figure out what works for you.

Then write it down somewhere so you aren’t making something up again
when you run out.

  <p class="admonition-title">Epilogue</p>

I found the recipe I started with\! [Gimme Some
Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/diy/diy-sea-salt-texturizing-hair-spray/)
has the information you need. Not much different than what you’ll find
here, though with less Dr. Strangelove.
