The site’s moved from [AWS][aws] to [Dreamhost][dreamhost]!

Nothing wrong with AWS S3 for static site hosting, but some of what I want to
do is easier to describe in a shell. Also – I don’t mind paying for a service,
but I got tired of usage-based billing. I ended up literally paying for typos
more than a few times. Give me a predictable bill please.

[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com
[dreamhost]: https://dreamhost.com
