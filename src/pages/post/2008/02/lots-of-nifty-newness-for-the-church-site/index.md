title: Lots of Nifty Newness for the Church Site

I volunteered a little while ago to be the maintainer for the [Green
Lake United Methodist Church](https://greenlakeumc.org). One limitation
of the site is the fact that the Webmaster was a barrier to getting new
content online. It’s a common problem, and had nothing to do with the
maliciousness of the Webmaster. It’s just the simple fact that the Web
dude is the only person who can post content. If the office manager
wants to post the Worship schedule, she has to ask the Webmaster. If the
pastor wants to present a message, she has to talk to the Webmaster. And
it goes on and on. Eventually the Webmaster implodes, because you can
only handle being the bottleneck for so long. The pressure becomes
especially great when there is time-sensitive information that needs to
be posted. You end up with a site that looks essentially static for
months at a time.

A blog seems like the most straightforward solution to the problem of
allowing non-technical people to post content including material that is
time-sensitive. I can worry about technical and design decisions, and
everybody else can worry about content. I installed
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) because it seemed like the best fit
for this site. WordPress has a large userbase, is easy to install and
maintain, and has plentiful plugins for extending functionality. They
would probably be able to find free or cheap help on the site if I get
hit by a bus or something. I added plugins for event scheduling and
reader feedback, a nice looking template, and fine-tuned one of my own
pictures of the church.

I do plan on adjusting things soon, but Worse-Is-Better so I’m making
what we have available as soon as possible. I’ve received kind words
about the new version on its first day live. It would be nice to make
things more distinctive, but that template is a great start.
