It’s time to revamp [coolnamehere](/categories/coolnamehere/).

I’ve been using a tweaked version of the
[Greenery](http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/2448) template from
[OSWD](http://oswd.org) for a couple of years now. I think it’s time for
a change. This time I actually concocted my own design using one of my
photos and [Yahoo’s YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui). I had so much
fun with YUI on [my church site](http://greenlakeumc.org) that I had to
try it out on my own site.

Here’s a screenshot of the old design:

There are a lot of things I liked about this design. The grass image
dividing the columns gave the site an attractive and natural touch that
had been missing before. On the other hand, I felt the need to tweak it
so that it would work in all the browsers I used. It’s nice, though.
Much better than the designs I had been coming up with on my own.

The new design has been widely praised by my sample group of two
incredibly non-biased people: my wife and my brother. Okay, I will
concede that they may have a bias. I like it in general, though. It’s
very … Seattle. Clouds, water, scotch bloom.

The design is still in progress. For starters, I *hate* the navtree
menu. That navtree is starting to look a little cumbersome, actually,
and is making me rethink how I want to handle navigation through the
site. Maybe a simple subpage listing such as the one generated by
ZenWeb. I’m also looking at new publishing options, and the one that is
most attractive to me right now is [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com).
It’s relatively old. It is also ridiculously easy to use and fairly
straightforward to enhance.

Oh, and I need to sort through the CSS, and probably the content itself.
Oh well, at least all the pages are in order.
