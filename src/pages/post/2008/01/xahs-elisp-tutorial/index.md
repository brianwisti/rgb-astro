I'd *really* love to master an editor. Any editor. [Vim](/tags/vim) has been my weapon
of choice for years, but [Emacs](/tags/emacs) has always intrigued me.
It's easier to use than Vim, but the Elisp language is the real draw. Vim's configuration /
scripting language is awkward at best. Elisp is cryptically lispish, but at least it is
possible to break it down without wondering what the heck `<sfile>` is supposed to be.

So yeah. I'm mostly a Vim guy but I'd love to get more out of my Emacs sessions. With that in
mind, I'll be taking a close look at Xah's [Emacs](http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html) and
[Elisp](http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp.html) tutorials.
