I just saw Petr Krenzelok's giddy announcement on the REBOL mailing list that a public alpha of REBOL 3 is available today. I've been waiting to see this for a while and can't even begin to describe how excited I am.

The official announcement is <a href="http://www.rebol.com/article/0347.html">here</a>. I just need to remember that it's an alpha. Pieces aren't going to work. Things will be strange. But it's out there for the bold to play with.

Of course I gotta get some work done, but you can be sure I'll be poking at this over the next couple of days.
