## Choose your weapon

As a geek, your text editor is your most important tool. Pick one or
two, and really get to know it. I donâ€™t care if you choose Emacs, vi,
SciTE, or whatever else. Pick it and learn how to use it. I want you to
*really* get the hang of your editing environment. Being more skilled
with your tools will make it easier for you to get work done. And geek
play, of course.
