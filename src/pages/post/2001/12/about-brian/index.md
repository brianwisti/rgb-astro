This page exists for historical purposes — so you can see the cute old
picture of me. More current versions of its information is in

Just want to contact me? That’s easy enough.

My name is Brian Wisti, and I am a geek. This site should provide plenty
of evidence for that. I write code for a living, and often write code as
a hobby.

I was born in 1972, in Tacoma, Washington. That’s in the northwestern
United States for those of you reading this from a great distance. I’ve
been living in Seattle, Washington since 1999, after quite a few years
living in different places. Seattle is a great city to be in, but I
wouldn’t mind visiting a lot of other places before I die.

I have more hobbies than I know what to do with. These days, I spend a
lot of time programming, knitting, or drawing. I spend more time
programming, but it’s hard to tell whether I’ve been programming or
drawing for more time. They both seem to satisfy my general urge to
create something. From other people, each gets a different reaction.
More people go "oh, cool" at my drawings. More people are willing to pay
me for my programming. My wife mainly benefits from the knitting, with
an endless supply of things I want her to wear. So I get to do all the
things I enjoy and stay very happy.
