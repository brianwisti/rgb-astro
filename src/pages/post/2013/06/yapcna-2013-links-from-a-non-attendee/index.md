[YAPC::NA](http://yapcna.org), the Yet Another Perl Conference for North
America, just happened. I didn’t go. Since I didn’t go, I want to
compile everything I can find about the conference in one place. Videos,
slides, blog posts, whatever.

<aside class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>


I ended up removing a few links that had been removed since first
publishing this post.

</aside>

I am ready to add, edit, or remove items as needed. Make your
suggestions or comments in the comments section.

There’s also an [Eventifier compilation of
YAPC::NA](http://eventifier.co/event/yapc13/), which includes most of
this and a lot of photos as well.
