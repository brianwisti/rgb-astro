I have been spending most of my free time working on aÂ [Rails project][] for the
[Mary's Place][] day shelter. At some point - probably after many scan/edit
cycles with [metric_fu][] -- it occurred to me that even though my Rails
knowledge has increased over the last year, my core Ruby skills have not. They
have stayed static. They may even have deteriorated a bit, since Rails does so
much work for the developer.

This seems like a perfect opportunity to reread the Pickaxe book [Programming
Ruby][]. This might not count as a reread, though. I have not read it cover to
cover since the second edition came out. They are on to the fourth edition now.
