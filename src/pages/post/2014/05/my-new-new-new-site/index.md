[GNU Emacs]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
[o-blog]: http://renard.github.io/o-blog/
[Org mode]: http://orgmode.org/
[static pages]: /categories/coolnamehere/
I have been exploring [GNU Emacs][] recently. As part of that
exploration, I decided to use [o-blog][]. Why? Well. I want to blog
more. I want to use Emacs more. I got tired of my WordPress
blog. o-blog sits on top of [Org mode][], which is the Killer App
of Emacs for me. Org mode is amazing. o-blog is nifty, and
relatively easy to get started with. I have fiddled with the
o-blog templates to suit my tastes. I replaced browser-side Less
CSS with a bit of Sass at build time. Eventually I'll
port the Wordpress posts to o-blog and maybe the old [static pages][] 
to something involving org-mode.

Just thinking and typing right now. You can go home if you want.

I will try to keep things a little better organized than the
WordPress blog. A bucket for each language was excessive. I'm
thinking categories for tools, programming, emacs, and
whatever. Tags can cut across categories. Programming would be the
general art of using words to make computers do things. Tools are
about specific ways to make life easier or extend your
capabilities. For example, a post about using [ack][] would go under
"Tools" and a post about using Perl to extend ack's functionality
would go under "Programming." Emacs is its own world, with its own
tools and programming. The default category is the more mundane blog
stuff: what I'm up to, what I had for dinner, the latest cat video
to catch my attention.

There is bound to be some overlap. I may need to fiddle with the
categories. That means a good site map is important. This is a good
start, though.

Anyways. I better post this now or I will keep fiddling with it
forever.
