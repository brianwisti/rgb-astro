Today I got to take part in a User Experience Research interview
with some fine folks from GitHub. It was straightforward. We chatted
for about half an hour, mostly discussing GitHub. Makes sense. They
learned how I used it. Since there is so little of GitHub that I
use, they got to show me some nifty things.
<!--more-->

["Explore"]: https://github.com/explore

Like the ["Explore"][] link up in the nav bar, for example. Any site's
"explore" link is generally useless, and often insulting - little
more than a collection of paid promoted links. By 2014 I have
learned to ignore the urge to explore. Turns out the GitHub
"Explore" is somewhat nifty. Maybe just for me. Anyways. It is a
collection of potentially interesting categories of projects hosted
on Github, followed by your basic trending /
starred-by-folks-you-follow / starred-by-staff blocks. I liked it. I
was surprised.

[GitHub Guides]: https://guides.github.com

They also told me about [GitHub Guides][], a more explicitly useful
link. Check it out. Documentation, pretty pictures, good
habits. Lots of stuff in there.

There were other things, but those two items are what stuck in my
head.

I told them the heavy emphasis on social interaction is what
distinguishes Github from similar services. I also said I wanted to
use that aspect more. So I followed them.
