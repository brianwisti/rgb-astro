I don't know about you, but I had a pleasant Saturday. It started with
an hour or so of the [Coursera][] [Programming Languages][] videos. I
learned a little bit about [SML][], and have been trying to remember
the instructor's caution about comparing what's learned in class to
other languages. It's supposed to be a fresh perspective on
programming.

Some time in the evening was spent playing Torchlight 2 and fiddling
with things on the Windows partition of my machine.

Recently I have been spending more time in Windows. I don't really
know why. Could just be a seasonal thing. Every few months I get bored
of the tools and languages I'm using, and start looking for new
combinations. Most of the Free and Open
Source Software that I enjoy is available on any operating system I
feel like using, so it isn't *that* big of a deal.

Sometimes I discover something completely new to me when I do these
switches. One of my discoveries this time around on Windows is
[chocolatey][]. chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It allows
you to install a surprising range of software utilities from an
administrative command line - `cmd.exe` or PowerShell will work.

[Paint.NET]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/paint.net/
[PuTTY]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/putty/

According to their front page, there are currently 2,257 unique
packages available in the chocolatey system. There are plenty of
expected FOSS tools such as editors and programming languages. There
are also many utilities that I always end up installing on Windows,
like [Paint.NET][] and [PuTTY][].

[Python]: https://www.python.org/
[Perl]: http://strawberryperl.com/
[Here's Python]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/python/
[Here's Perl]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/StrawberryPerl/

I didn't find chocolatey until after installing my core [Python][] and
[Perl][] toolset, but both are available. [Here's Python][] and
[Here's Perl][]. It looks like the version of Strawberry Perl in
chocolately is a little behind, so it probably helps to pay attention
to available versions.

[Ruby]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/ruby/
[Emacs]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/Emacs/

[Ruby][] and [Emacs][] are installed via chocolatey, though. I
definitely want to spend some more time with chocolatey. It seems
quite nice at first glance.
