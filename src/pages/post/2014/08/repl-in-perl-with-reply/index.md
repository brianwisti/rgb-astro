Time for a quick post about [Reply](https://metacpan.org/release/Reply),
a new [Perl](http://perl.org) toy from [Jesse Luers](http://tozt.net/).
There will not be much for me to say, because I have only been playing
with it for about twenty minutes.

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

This post used Questhub.io for a subject. Unfortunately, that site is no
longer with us.

Reply is a
[REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
for Perl. It is an interactive shell that simplifies quick
experimentation with language features. It is extensible via a
[plugin](https://metacpan.org/source/DOY/Reply-0.35/lib/Reply/Plugin.pm)
system that I may look at later if I have more time.

## Installation

I use [perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) and
[cpanm](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus), so installation was
easy.

    $ cpanm Reply

Oh. It is worth pointing out that if you do not have [GNU
Readline](http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) or a
similar library installed, you will not get command-line editing or
history in Reply.

## Hello Reply

The `reply` command starts a new session. Once the session is going,
itâ€™s pretty much just Perl.

    $ reply
    0> "Hello World"
    $res[0] = 'Hello World'

    1> my $name = "Brian"
    $res[1] = 'Brian'

    2> "Hello $name"
    $res[2] = 'Hello Brian'

Getting user input via `STDIN` works pretty much how you would expect.

    3> chomp( $name = <STDIN> )
    Brian
    $res[3] = 1

    4> $name
    $res[4] = 'Brian'

Defining subroutines is no big deal.

    5> sub greeting { "Hello $_[0]" }
    6> greeting $name
    $res[5] = 'Hello Brian'

And `exit` will quit Reply. It all seems straightforward.

    7> exit

## A Marginally More Complex Example

I have been working on a little experiment: fetching Questhub.io JSON
with [Mojo::UserAgent](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/UserAgent) and
[Mojo::JSON](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/JSON). I decided to see if
I could try some of that experiment in Reply.

    0> use Mojo::UserAgent
    1> use Mojo::JSON 'decode_json'
    2> my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new
    $res[0] = bless( {}, 'Mojo::UserAgent' )

    3> sort map { $_->{name} } @{ decode_json( $ua->get( 'https://questhub.io/api/realm' )->res->body ) }
    $res[1] = [
      'Big Data',
      'Chaos',
      'Code',
      'DC Metro Region',
      'Fitness',
      'Haskell',
      'Japanese',
      'Lisp',
      'MOOCs',
      'Meta',
      'Node.js',
      'Perl',
      'Portland',
      'Python (Ru)',
      'Read',
      'Testing',
      'Yoga + Meditation'
    ]

Yes, I can.

## What Do I Think?

I like Reply overall. I am not used to thinking in REPL terms when it
comes to Perl, and need to spend more than twenty minutes with it. I
like Reply enough that I do expect to spend more time with it.

I noticed that my coding style was more terse within the confines of
Reply. Maybe I should install GNU Readline support on my machine or
enable the [Editor
plugin](https://metacpan.org/pod/Reply::Plugin::Editor).
