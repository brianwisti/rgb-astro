I installed [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) 14.04 on a partition of my laptop today. This is not a
novelty. What *is* unusual is the fact that today I decided to track
what I installed before I felt like I had a "Minimum Viable Linux."
Turns out there was quite a bit.

  artisanal lifestyle are too cool for Dropbox.

  least redirect it.

Other things will be installed, of course. I'll probably add the
official Oracle JDK, Inkscape, and assorted other things. And many
things will be installed via package managers for the assorted
languages I play with. This list is just the core things I need to feel
comfortable and ready to work.
