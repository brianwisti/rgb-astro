Just don't even ask. I am in a highly fickle phase with the Web site.

Despite an excellent suggestion from [Miguel Grinberg][] to try 
[Frozen Flask][], I am too far along in this week of [Jekyll][] to change 
my mind now.

Maybe next week.

It is tempting to write a lengthy blog post describing everything I did to 
integrate the old [coolnamehere][] pages, get a breadcrumb trail on every
page, set up tags, and the rest. I am not in the mood. There are other
things I want to write about. Heck, I may have this site published via 
yet another tool next week. I will just list the resources that made it 
easier to assemble the site in its current form with Jekyll.
