I’ll admit it. When I first got into Web programming,
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) was not my
favorite language. It took too much work to get anything done, and then
it wouldn’t work half the time on other browsers. That’s the other
thing. It was only useful to most of us on Web browsers.
[Perl](/tags/perl/) was funny-looking, but worked on nearly any machine
and could make the most elaborate Web applications that worked
regardless of what browser your visitor was using. You could even write
applications that had nothing to do with the Web, using Perl/Tk and
CPAN.

Well that was 1997, and a lot has happened since then. Perl is still
funny-looking and capable of nearly anything, but it’s not the only
language in town these days. I have been spending a lot of time with
JavaScript lately, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much the
language has improved since I first looked at it. I’d like to spend a
little time on using JavaScript. That’s something else to tackle in my
copious free time.
