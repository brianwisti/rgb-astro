This is unusual. I’ve come across the first language that I don’t want
to tell you about. I don’t know *why* I want to keep
[REBOL](http://www.rebol.com/) a secret. It has been very useful even in
the limited roles that I have given it so far. The language is
consistent and pleasant to work with. It has a richness of datatypes
that just can’t be matched by other languages. The GUI library, View, is
surprisingly straightforward for simple tasks, and there are excellent
libraries like RebGUI to make it just as easy for more elaborate
interfaces.

Maybe I just want to think of REBOL as my secret weapon. Languages
aren’t like that, though, so my conscience tells me that I must at least
mention it to you before burying myself back in the routine of my day.

So what do I use REBOL for? Well, I spent about five minutes making a
simple GUI application to help me balance my checkbook, for starters. I
enter my transactions, it saves them and shows me my current balance
*(along with the record of previous transactions)*. It’s really nothing
special, but it was disturbingly easy to create.

Give REBOL a look-see. You might like it.

Oh, there is a random bit of trivia that amused and unnerved me when I
first discovered it. REBOL Technologies is based in Ukiah, California,
where I spent those vitally important early childhood years. I was only
there from age six to age eight, but a lot of my thoughts, beliefs,
etcetera were established among the redneck hippies of northern
California. And now there’s this cool language coming from the same
town. Freaky.

REBOL Links
-----------

The Rebol community is incredibly active for its small size. To me, this
says a lot about Rebol’s potential in the future, and I would like to do
what I can to encourage others to at least take a look at the language
and some of the sites devoted to Rebol out on the Web. There are more
links than these, but I’m pointing out the ones that I have been using
or referring to a lot.

### Tutorials

- <http://musiclessonz.com/rebol_tutorial.html> - An *excellent*
  introduction to REBOL and REBOL/View. More thorough than any of my
  meanderings and updated more frequently, too.

### Applications created with REBOL

- [AltMe](http://www.altme.com/) : An instant messenger
- <http://www.vanillasite.at/> : A Wiki engine
- <http://www.rebol.com/docs/desktop.html> : The REBOL/View Desktop is
  yet another impressive distributed application, allowing you to
  peruse the World Wide Reb.
- <http://www.rebol.org/> : I know I already mentioned it in
  "Community", but it was built with and runs on REBOL. You really
  have to start digging into it before you appreciate what a fine
  piece of work this site is.
