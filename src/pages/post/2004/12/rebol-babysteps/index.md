Introduction
------------

Right. Here is this language that you’ve never heard of:
[REBOL](http://www.rebol.com/). I think we should learn how to use it
together, sort of a \`\`Babysteps'' approach. You and I can add REBOL to
our steadily expanding toolkit of programming languages.

And remember to just ignore people when they ask you “Why should I learn
REBOL (or Perl, or Python, or Ruby) instead of Perl (or Python, or Ruby,
or Java)?” You and I are the sort of people who learn a language *in
addition* to the ones we already know, not *instead of* the one we were
taught in college.

Okay, maybe that is a little rude. But it works like this: my music
teacher taught me that each time you learn a new instrument, it gets a
little easier to learn new ones, because you are developing a greater
understanding of how to make music. You will also know how to choose the
best instrument for a particular piece, because you understand the
differences between each available choice. I didn’t learn much
musically. I only managed two things:

1.  Use a trumpet to make a sound like a dying elephant.
2.  Use a clarinet to make a sound like an angry weasel.

… so I’m sure he’ll be happy to learn that I walked away with *something* from his class.

So yeah. That’s why you want to learn REBOL. So you can make a sound
like an angry weasel. No, make that a *happy* weasel.

I add a new page to this tutorial every once in a while, but I don’t
believe it’s the best REBOL tutorial available. That honor goes to Nick
Antonaccio’s [Rebol Programming For The Absolute
Beginner](http://musiclessonz.com/rebol_tutorial.html). I think you
should go over there and check it out now. Go ahead, I don’t mind.
