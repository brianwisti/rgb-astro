Okay, I’ll be honest. LISP scares the dickens out of me. It’s ancient by
the standards of computer languages. The language is completely
different from any of the stuff I use in my day-to-day programming. Yet
it has all the features of those languages and more. Garbage collection?
Got it. The ability to pass functions around as easily as an integer?
Done (and not in a cranky C function pointer manner, either).
Object-oriented programming? Well sure, but you might not need it as
much as you thought you did. Not only that - LISP has had these features
for *decades*.

[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) is a high-profile proponent of
LISP. He seems to think that his early success in developing online
applications was due to the power and flexibility of LISP and his theory
that independent-minded hackers are innately destined for greater things
than the mundane cattle that walk the earth. I’m not going to argue with
him, since I’m not a master of LISP, business management, or
socio-economic theory. I do wish he’d find something more interesting to
talk about than hackers, though.

Sorry, I digressed. As I was saying: Paul Graham is a high-profile
proponent of LISP. His book [ANSI Common
LISP](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html) is on the bookshelf of nearly
every would-be LISP hacker, and for good reason. His book is concise and
informative. It continues to be useful after finishing the tutorial
section, thanks to a convenient reference section in the back. You’ll
probably get some respect from your fellow nerds if you have any of Paul
Graham’s LISP titles on your shelf. That includes those who get bored
and annoyed while reading his
[essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) discussing how the
ancient Egyptians who designed the pyramids were actually hackers who
utilized the existing labor system in previously unimagined ways. Note:
I don’t think he’s actually written that essay yet.

*ANSI Common LISP* is popular and useful, but I needed a friendlier
approach to learning this intimidating language. That’s why I preferred
[Practical Common LISP](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) by Peter
Seibel. It takes a more leisurely stroll through the awkward first steps
with LISP. The author understands the widespread fear of LISP and takes
it into account through each lesson and project. You will definitely
have an understanding of the language and its possible uses by the time
you’re finished. I highly recommend *Practical Common LISP* for your
first book as a [Smug Lisp
Weenie](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SmugLispWeenie). Then go right into Paul
Graham’s books or some of the arcane titles that come out of the MIT
Press with titles that are sure to impress your friends and frighten the
neighbors.
