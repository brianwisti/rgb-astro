[PHP](http://www.php.net/) is great. It is easy to learn and easy to
use. Of course, it is also easy to make a project that is so amazingly
baroque that mere humans have no chance of ever editing it. This is a
trait that PHP shares with one of its biggest rivals,
[Perl](/tags/perl/). It can be funny to listen to an argument between
PHP and Perl folks about why their favorite is the best and the other
guy is the worst. The other guy is always “unstructured and unsuitable
for real projects”, while the favorite is “fast and expressive.”

These folks need to settle down, because they’re both right. Perl and
PHP show an obvious influence from the world of shell scripting, where
the goal is to get stuff done now. This means that you can put together
a project with amazing speed, but it takes a lot of discipline to keep
your code in a clean, maintainable state. You could say that about lots
of languages, though. My advice is that you go with PHP if that’s your
preference. Don’t let anybody bother you about your choice. It’s a
regular part of my site-building toolkit, and I’m pretty much guilt-free
about it.

Plus, I am really excited about PHP 5, which provides many new features
and better support for object-oriented programming.
