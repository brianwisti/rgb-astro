Another one of those "no I’m not dead" posts. Instead of writing I’ve
been [drawing](/tags/drawing) quite a bit this year. The writing will
resume. For now, enjoy a sample of my favorite sketches from the last
several months.

Meanwhile, I’m also getting my site to work with
[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I’m not entirely sure what that means
yet, but the claim of improving quality of connection between
author-owned Web content appeals to me. I love better organization and
the possibility of better connection for my stuff, so I’ve followed the
steps at [IndieWebify.Me](https://indiewebify.me/) partway through level
2. Just need to understand
[Webmentions](https://github.com/converspace/webmention/blob/master/README.md).
