This is from Charlene Schurch’s book *Sensational Knitted Socks*. Nearly
every sock I make is, to be honest. Great book. The yarn is [Cascade
Yarns Heritage
Silk](http://www.cascadeyarns.com/cascade-HeritageSilk.htm) 5608 "Pine".
A single 100 gram hank served almost perfectly for my US size 10.5 feet.
The amount of yarn left over (5 grams) is so small that it’s nearly a
choking hazard.

I blocked these on sock hangers, but that made them look *more* lumpy.
The socks are a little larger than the hangers. You can see where the
corner of the hanger deformed them a bit at the top of the heel. I
assume that will bounce back after wearing and washing. Still - future
pairs will likely get blocked flat.

They look and feel great on my feet. For the first time I understand why
my ex was always requesting more socks.
