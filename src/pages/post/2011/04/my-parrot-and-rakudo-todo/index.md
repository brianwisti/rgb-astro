This is more of a personal reminder than a big announcement or anything like that.
I have a tendency to get an idea in my head and then lose it when a bright shiny object comes into my field of view.

[Rakudo]: http://rakudo.org

I have a lot of love for the [Parrot] Virtual Machine, but my Parrot projects have been left sadly neglected for several
months now. Spring is here. The cherry blossoms are almost done blooming in Seattle. Parrot stable is at 3.0. Dev is at
3.2, which means a new stable release is days away. [Rakudo][] has moved on to a 3-month cycle relying on the stable
Parrot releases. That means my focus on the stable Parrot is useful.

[Parrot Babysteps]: /post/2009/07/parrot-babysteps
[parrot-handler]: https://github.com/brianwisti/parrot-handler

The [Parrot Babysteps][] still talk about Parrot 2.6. My [parrot-handler][] project sits idle and unloved. This is
unacceptable.

I have heard rumblings about PIR going away. This is a source of frustration for me, since PIR is the sole focus of the
Parrot Babysteps. But hey - it might not happen, and maybe it's not such a bad thing if it does. There are plenty of
nifty Parroty ideas to occupy my time while I dig through the mailing list archives to see if I can determine PIR's
fate.

I have a Babystep path in mind for using the Parrot tools to build a custom language, and I could use the basic template
of the PIR Babysteps for Rakudo. Actually, I could use that basic template for Python and Ruby, too. One thing at a
time, though.

Here's my Parrot / Rakudo TODO list, in no particular order.

* Update the existing Parrot Babysteps for Parrot 3.0
* Work on parrot-handler, or at least poke at it.
* Start a Babysteps path for building a language with Parrot (a language *I* want to use, obviously)
* Start a Rakudo Babysteps path modelled after the existing Parrot PIR Babysteps.

Now I should get back to work, which nothing to do with Parrot, PIR, Rakudo, Python, or Ruby.
