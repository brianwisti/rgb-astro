## Introduction

If you have never programmed before in your life, then do I have the perfect 
programming language for you. It's called [Python][]. It is easy to learn, 
flexible, and loaded with capabilities that you never thought would be so easy 
to use. Imagine your thrill when you write a complete program in just a few lines!

If you have spent years programming Perl, and are just about sick of all of the 
weird little context dependencies ("My function does this when you hand it a 
single object, and that when you hand it a list, unless you are assigning the 
result to a list, in which case it does this other thing"), then do I have the 
perfect language for you. It's called Python. It has clear, unambigous syntax, 
and it is simple to create your own modules and objects. Imagine your thrill 
when you write a complete program in just a few lines, and somebody else can 
read it!

This is a tutorial to help the non-programmer learn the basics of using 
Python. When you are done with it, you will be ready to learn this new 
language, and have no problems figuring out where to find the information you 
need to go farther.

Experienced programmers may get some small value out of this, too, but you will 
get bored quickly. I am aiming for simplicity, rather than rigid accuracy. 
There is always the official [Python tutorial][] to provide an introduction for 
veterans.

If anybody has any suggestions or comments about this tutorial, please let me know!

I hope you enjoy this!
