I don't even know how many hours I spent on this.  An hour or two a night — but
not every night — since November or so?

I like it, however long I spent drawing the dang thing.

[Linea][linea] takes a very constrained approach to tools.  No automatic
symmetry.  No blend modes.  Only five layers.  Makes it feel like a paper
sketch book, but with bonuses.  Their approach to color palettes is one of
those bonuses.  I used their predefined "Art Deco" palette for this.

You can grab the line work yourself if you want something to color.
