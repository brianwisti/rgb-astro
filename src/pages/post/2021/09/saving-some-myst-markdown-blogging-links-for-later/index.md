title: Saving some MyST Markdown blogging links for later
---

Got distracted by a note from [@choldgraf][choldgraf] about [MyST][myst], a Markdown flavor
aimed at technical writing, in a [Twitter conversation][tweet-thread] that was not
specifically about MyST.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two things you may be interested in:<br><br>Markdown in Sphinx : <a href="https://t.co/52Rj05JsqV">https://t.co/52Rj05JsqV</a><br><br>Automatically rebuild are load docs in sphinx: <a href="https://t.co/9lvFyCbB0W">https://t.co/9lvFyCbB0W</a><br><br>Pydata theme: <a href="https://t.co/9qXss5cN15">https://t.co/9qXss5cN15</a><br><br>Lots of other nice themes here: <a href="https://t.co/27G9oawNVu">https://t.co/27G9oawNVu</a></p>&mdash; Chris Holdgraf (@choldgraf) <a href="https://twitter.com/choldgraf/status/1433802076438482949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This distracted me from the [NuxtJS][nuxtjs] blog idea that was distracting me from a
[Nikola][nikola] blog idea that was distracting me from an attempt at porting my
site to [Astro][astro] that was distracting me from a [Nanoc][nanoc]-in-Python project
idea that was distracting me from preparing a client site proposal that was
distracting me from Labor Day weekend prep that was distracting me from the
work chat that was distracting me from work.

I had a question about using MyST for blogging, but decided to look it up for
myself. Then I was going to tweet it but got distracted by the thought that I
needed a more persistent record what with all the distraction.

The question I almost tweeted:

> Are there plugins or tools for using MyST to author blog posts?

My answer:

> Why yes there are! A quick search found these, and there are doubtless
> other resources.
>
> - [markdown-it-myst][] for the `.js` blogs
> - A [myst Nikola plugin][myst-nikola-plugin] for the `.py` blogs

Could probably even use it in [Hugo][hugo] if I make another [neovim plugin][neovim-plugin] for
`.md.txt` files.

:::note

Oh heck. I added a [bookmark][] for MyST's Jupyter Book parent project not long
ago.  BRB adding a "markdown" tag.

Anyways, time to refill the coffee and — flips past the Distraction Cards
— work! Oh jeez yeah work.
