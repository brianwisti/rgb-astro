[PHP]: /tags/php
[Zend Framework]: https://framework.zend.com
[1.0 release]: http://devzone.zend.com/article/2262-Zend-Framework-1.0.0-production-release
[CakePHP]: http://cakephp.org/

[PHP][] may not be my favorite language, but the last couple of years have seen
profound improvement. I got the urge to start playing with [Zend Framework][]
last week. It isn't too shabby. Yesterday Zend made a [1.0 release][], which
is a good milestone for PHP types to learn about MVC and ACLs etc. You know,
other than the ones who are already using [CakePHP][]. You're probably doing
just fine.

[PHPUnit]: http://www.phpunit.de
[SimpleTest]: http://simpletest.org

Oh, and I've been messing about with [PHPUnit][] as well. It doesn't feel as
comfortable as [SimpleTest][], but I would be willing to use it in my everyday
unit testing.
