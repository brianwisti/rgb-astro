I haven't been on the Rebol3 <a href="http://www.altme.com/">AltME</a> world for a few weeks, mainly because AltME isn't working correctly on Linux. The only time I log on is on my OS X machine if I remember or on Windows via VMWare if I'm not too busy. Turns out that Maxim (<a href="http://www.pointillistic.com/">pointillistic.com</a>, I think) left a message for me that <a href="http://www.pointillistic.com/open-REBOL/moa/steel/retools/remark/index.html">reMark</a> is available for messing with. I think the idea is that you can use reMark to build static Web sites, very similar to the way that <a href="http://webmake.taint.org/">WebMake</a> or <a href="http://zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenWeb/index.html">ZenWeb</a> do. This is <a href="http://rebol.com/">Rebol</a>, of course, so the approach is going to be a bit different.

I will be experimenting with reMark over the next few days/weeks to see what I can do with it. You can too, but remember that it is alpha and Maxim might be a little busy to do intense development on it.
