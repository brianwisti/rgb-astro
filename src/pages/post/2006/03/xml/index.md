XML is the core language of the Web. It forms the foundation for nearly 
everything you read with your browser. You might not know this, though, 
because of the great number of languages and acronyms you find. Web pages are 
written in XHTML, news feeds are written in RSS, and many applications 
communicate to each other with XML-RPC. If you use Google Talk, then you are 
relying on the Jabber protocol. What do each of these languages have in common? 
They are all XML languages.

How is that possible? XML gives you a set of rules for defining new computer 
languages. Although nearly any sort of language can be created, XML is most 
appropriate for two tasks.

+ Text formatting
+ Data exchange

"Text formatting" is probably the most familiar to you. Many Web pages are 
formatted with XHTML - a cleaned-up version of HTML, which you may be more
familiar with. XHTML provides structure to the documents, making them easily 
processed by Web browsers and specialized scripts. All the headers, paragraphs, 
lists and links are described in XHTML. A well-formed Web document can be 
printed, viewed in a monitor, or read out loud by a text-to-speech program. 
XML provides the rules which make it that much easier for your Web page to be 
considered well-formed.

Since XML is essentially the language of the Web, you will have no trouble 
finding helpful resources in getting familiar with XML.
