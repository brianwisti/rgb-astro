All right. Real quick, before I get distracted by something else. I’m
over in the Windows partition again. I want to read my assorted ebooks
and other PDFs.

Looked around at several readers — rather, several PDF editing suites,
as plain old readers seem vanishingly rare. Settled on [STDU
Viewer](http://www.stdutility.com/stduviewer.html).

STDU Viewer supports several document and image formats. It’s free for
noncommercial or educational use. I can read my PDF and EPub files, in a
reasonable tabbed interface.

That’s honestly all I need. But being able to highlight passages is a
nice bonus.

STDU Viewer does not alter the files directly when highlighting.
Instead, it stores information about highlighted files and passages in
`%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\STDUViewer\Highlight.xml`.

STDU Viewer also lets you create split views of your document. Handy
when you’re doing exercises\! It doesn’t let you open another document
in the split, unfortunately.

## Caveats

1.  Use the "Download free STDU Viewer" link. I couldn’t get the MSI
    installer to work.
2.  I couldn’t find any documentation. Maybe that’s in the paid version?
3.  Which reminds me: I couldn’t find a link to buy STD Viewer if I was
    so inclined. Presumably you get pricing information by emailing
    support (link in the *?* → *About* menu item)
4.  Here’s a bit of documentation: bookmark and highlight passages by
    selecting them with the "Select Text" tool and right clicking over
    selected text.

## Tweaks

I don’t like clicking any more than I have to, so I set extra shortcut
keys in Options. One for highlighting with `h`, and a couple to get `j`
/ `k` scrolling like I’m accustomed to in my Linux desktop.

## That’s it, really

Despite my annoyance at the documentation, [STDU
Viewer](http://www.stdutility.com/stduviewer.html) provides the
functionality I needed in a PDF reader. No more, and no less. Check it
out if that sounds pleasing to you\!
