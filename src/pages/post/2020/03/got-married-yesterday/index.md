<aside class="admonition">

I mentioned it on
[hackers.town](https://hackers.town/@randomgeek/103853335008640787) /
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianwisti/status/1240848019077111814).
Even updated my relationship status on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brianwisti/posts/10158601243074665).
I’ll probably leave LinkedIn alone for the moment. But worth remembering
here as well.

2020.

[COVID-19](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/biography-new-coronavirus/608338/)
has shut down pretty much
[everything](https://publichealthinsider.com/2020/03/17/events-eating-out-and-retail-whats-allowed-and-whats-not/)
in the city and
[beyond](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-comes-spring-break-locals-close-florida-beaches-after-governor-n1163741).
Large gatherings are forbidden, or at least strongly discouraged.

Thank goodness.

No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us
an acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.

A *very* small affair. Five of us and four — her [eldest
daughter](https://twitter.com/qlitterbang), [my
mom](https://www.shellybedsaul.com) (subliminal message: BUY THEIR ART)
plus a couple friends who couldn’t be there because quarantine —
watching on Facebook group video chat. Might have added more, but the
technical issues were complicated enough as it was.

One of our friends got ordained so she could officiate. We wouldn’t have
to worry about the courthouses closing\! The same friend was sort of an
anti-chaperone at an early event. She made sure we were dancing close
enough and that our hands were outside the Respectful First Dance Zone.

And yesterday she made sure we would be able to get married. It’s the
circle of life. Or something. It’s very sweet is what it is.

So yeah I’m happy. And the honeymoon will be nice — whenever the world
opens back up again so we can have one.
