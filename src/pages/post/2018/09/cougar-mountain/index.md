The
[park](https://www.kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/parks-and-natural-lands/popular-parks/cougar.aspx)
sits just outside Bellevue, Washington. There’s been a lot of
construction in the area thanks to the steady influx of tech workers and
others. Passing housing development after housing development along the
way gave me low expecations for the park itself. Suddenly there were
more trees than houses, and moments later there was a 3,100 acre
woodland park.

## Be careful

Cougar Mountain only became a park relatively recently. Warning signs
remind you about the area’s long history as a coal mine. Collapsed mines
could collapse further with just a little weight on them. A decades-old
underground fire presents ongoing
[danger](https://www.heraldnet.com/news/cougar-mountain-mines-still-a-danger/)
from heat and toxic fumes.

Basically: if a sign tells me to stay back, I stay back.

The trails are well-labeled, perhaps partly due to those hazards. I
still managed to get myself turned around, because there were [so many
trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar_Mountain_Regional_Wildland_Park#Official_Trails).
Somewhere along the way I lost my paper map, but had enough signal to
get the Washington Trails Association
[Trailblazer](https://www.wta.org/our-work/about/trailblazer-mobile-app)
app installed on my phone and follow the links to a PDF map.

## Look at the trees

I think I focused a little too much on the hazards. Those are really in
specific sections of the park, and are all clearly indicated. The park
itself is lovely, green, and very Pacific Northwest.

We have some lovely woods around here. I started taking that for granted
over the years. My assorted [sauntering](/tags/sauntering) trips have
done a great job reminding me to not do that.

The trees on Cougar Mountain are young. When the mines started winding
down, logging picked up. I saw several thick old stumps near the trail,
giving me a hint of what the older growth must have looked like.

Some of those stumps had sprouts on them, while a few had full grown
trees.

We got some rain recently. Everything that could be green was very green
indeed. Even the rocks. I walked a little out of my way to see Fantastic
Erratic, a [glacial
erratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic) boulder left
here by glacier action in some past ice age.

My image shows the scale poorly. That single rock is roughly fifteen
feet high. I took a rest break sitting on top of it, with room to
stretch.

## Anyways

I spent three hours walking about ten miles of trails around Cougar
Mountain, enjoying the scenery and history. It didn’t feel as epic as
[walking up a mountain](/post/2018/09/mount-si/), but I want to avoid
chasing that "epic" feeling. I’m not racking up accomplishments. I’m
getting out and appreciating more of the world around me. That includes
epic moments, little details, and everything in between.
