I adapted the [Nederburg][] theme for my [Hugo][] site. I probably won't keep it but I'll darn well use it for a
bit.

There are many bits that I like but it feels heavy for my taste. I enjoyed making things work within my own
quirky taxonomy. Maybe I'll try a different theme later â€“ Hugo has [many themes][]. Maybe I'll try harder at
making my own since I'm so fussy.
