As mentioned [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianwisti/status/978439728226738176):

> An hour and a half for a fifteen minute interview of which they used ten seconds for their two minute bit
> but OMG I'M ON TV

> (and they finally stopped showing my number in the clear)

The interview mainly provided a "Facebook User" reaction to news about Facebook [logging text and call
metadata][] on Android devices, which got more attention thanks to people checking their data after the
currently most recent [Cambridge Analytica][] scandal. I tell you what: my friends who never joined Facebook
are feeling justifiably smug.

Alas, my awkward attempts to plug [Mastodon][], [Signal][], and [Telegram][] went nowhere.

The East Coast feed included a clear shot of my phone number on the Messenger screen. That led
to some amusing texts — and phone calls, but I never answer my phone so that had no impact. They
edited that overshare after a couple hours and the texts stopped.

Most importantly, I got an awful new profile image for FB and Twitter — thanks to a Twitter friend sending the
suggestion with a particularly choice screenshot —  *and* I got to show off my [Boy Beanie][] on national
news.
