I made  myself a hat and gloves in matching colors for winter.

The gloves use the same [Son of Stitch 'n Bitch][] pattern as the [purple beer gloves][] I knitted this
summer. This pair turned out much better. Learning through repetition! However, that Loops & Threads "Impeccable"
yarn is far too stiff for gloves. I would prefer a sportweight blend to this worsted weight acrylic
for things that need to move with my hands.

I lost the label for the hat yarn but it's probably Patons North America Classic Wool Worsted. So soft and
cozy on my head. I accidentally changed tension once I picked up speed, resulting in an interesting gauge
effect along the bottom ribbing, but that is already becoming less pronounced with wear. You can also see
twisted stiches where I recovered a row but mounted those stitches incorrectly. This happened plenty of times
in the past, but I wanted to remember these little mistakes for future projects.

This isn't me being overly fussy. It's just me moving past the beginner mode of "Yay I finished something!" to
hopefully more intermediate habits that ask "how will I do better next time?"

The hat pattern came from [The Knitter's Handy Book of Patterns][] by Ann Budd. As I get more
comfortable with knitting, my interests move from specific patterns to templates and techniques. This
book seems a good step in that direction so far. Quite a few tables and charts, which calls out to old
memories of gaming books. The tables are just math helpers though. I can see not needing them after a certain
point. That's the day I'll be able to knit custom fit stuff from memory. Something to look forward to!
