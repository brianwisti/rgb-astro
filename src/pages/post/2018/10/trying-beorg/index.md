This is not a review. This is me, excitedly sharing screenshots of the
shiny thing I am playing with.

<aside class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

My beorg screenshots are in the Dark theme, which is currently the only
paid add-on for the app. All functionality I look at today is part of
the free core. I’m perfectly happy putting out 99 cents if it helps
development a little bit.

You can also contribute directly to feature development by making a
contribution in Settings.

</aside>

Does [beorg](https://beorgapp.com/) support your favorite [Org
mode](https://orgmode.org/) feature? I have no idea. But I can add,
schedule, edit, and save tasks.

You *could* manage everything on your phone, but synchronization is an
important feature for me. Synchronizing org files via
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) – or
[WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) if that’s more your thing
– works in both directions. I prefer [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
but I’ll take what I can get. Who knows? Maybe I’ll figure out WebDAV
later.

## TODO view

The TODO view lists tasks, including clear indications of scheduled
completion – assuming you understand the notation.

The Rainer König Org
[tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQS06Qjnkcc&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE)
on YouTube are great stuff. I’m going through them again myself for a
refresher, and I highly recommend them if you want to learn Emacs Org
mode.

The TODO view supports multiple filters.

## Notifications

The app icon badge shows the count of overdue tasks.

Alarms pop up for deadlines.

I better wrap it up.

## Also

beorg includes other features I don’t feel like looking at today.

The Agenda view integrates with your calendar events, which is both very
handy and not something I feel comfortable sharing with the entire world
:smile:

The Files view gives you something closer to a raw edit of your Org
files, but honestly that’s pretty darned clunky on a phone for me. For
the moment I’ll stick with high level task management on the phone, and
Emacs org mode if I need anything more involved.

## Anyways

Try out [beorg](https://beorgapp.com/) if you’re on iOS. Read the
[manual](https://beorgapp.com/manual/) for a more in-depth look at
features and usage. I’m going to go reschedule that art project. I have
other things that are higher priority.
