I wanted to see my own take on the [Vegvísir][], an Icelandic symbol also called a "Nordic Compass".

After a *lot* of work my favorite part was the underlying rough line work. So I kept that and scrapped the
rest.

I will probably make more attempts drawing this symbol. Read up on it studying mythology, folklore, and
symbolism when I was a kid, then forgot about it until it started cropping up in my life recently. This will
do for a start though.

All I know for sure about the Vegvísir is this description from the 19th Century [Huld manuscript][].

Who wouldn't like that?
