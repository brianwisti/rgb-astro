Dog and I saw a [Pearl Jam](https://pearljam.com) logo tag while walking
near [Easy Street Records](https://easystreetonline.com) this morning.

Probably something to do with this sign right next to the tag.

![Easy Street reader board](announce.jpg
  "Easy Street announcement for 'Pearl Jam Home Shows Aug 8 & 10'")

All right, so what does the sign mean by "Home Shows?" At first I
thought it described some special in-store event, since Easy Street has
associated with Pearl Jam for a while. Last year the business marked the
band’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by putting up a
[pop-up store](https://www.easystreetonline.com/NewsItem/6863) – a
corner dedicated to the band’s music and so on.

Oh good. I found [an
explanation](https://pearljam.com/thehomeshows/seattle-wa) on the band’s
site:

> Most of us grew up here. Over the past 28 years, the City of Seattle’s
> population has grown by 40%. The region’s homelessness population is
> now the third largest in the country, with over 12,000 people living
> without shelter on any one night. This is not a number to be proud of.
> 
> As part of The Home Shows Initiative, more than 140 businesses,
> individuals, government agencies, and foundations are banding together
> to fight homelessness in King County. Join us. Take action and learn
> more about this crisis.

Nice. I knew Pearl Jam involved themselves in local homelessness issues
— they [gave a
donation](http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/blog/thank-you-pearl-jam/) to
[Mary’s Place](http://www.marysplaceseattle.org) a few years back — but
I forgot the name of their project.

The "Home Shows" that Easy Street Records is promoting are at Safeco
Field, and unfortunately the venue sold out. I guess not "unfortunately"
since some of that money goes to support homeless people.

If you want to contribute to the Home Fund, you can always
[donate](https://www.uwkc.org/home-show/), or make a special day of it
by going out for food or beverages at a partner restaurant on Wednesday
August 8, [Home Shows Restaurant
Night](https://pearljam.com/acts/news/the-home-shows-restaurant-partners).
As of the moment I write these words, that is tomorrow.

Anyways, yeah. I liked the tag. Dog had no opinion on the matter.
