A friend asked me to crochet a potholder based on an image she saw
online. I tracked the image down to its source: the "ManHandle Pot
Holder" on Margaret Calver’s
[ayarnnut](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ayarnnut) Etsy store.

The pattern wasn’t too hard to figure out. I made several potholders as
I worked through the process.

- chain a few - I settled on four
- increase at a pace you like until you reach the desired circumference
- single chain around until you reach the desired length
- single chain some texture where it looks about right

This description is deliberately vague because I made each potholder
different, both for fun and because the natural world is full of
variety.

I shared images of the collection as I worked on it. Some people — okay,
some *guys* — presented surprising ideas for the intended usage. This is
not a penis sweater. If nothing else, think of the chafing. And related
to their bold claims about needing one that was significantly longer:
you don’t want excess material flopping uselessly. That’s a safety
hazard.

The potholder fits over the pot handle like so.

But you do you.

Want one? Crochet it yourself\! Don’t want to do that? [Buy

this idea gets some money\!
