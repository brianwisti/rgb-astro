[Island Center
Forest](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/island-center-forest)
contains roughly ten miles of trails. I walked about six of them
yesterday. Today my feet hurt.

## Getting There

Island Center Forest is a 363 acre wooded nature preserve in the middle
of [Vashon Island](http://www.vashonchamber.com/), which is a short
ferry ride from West Seattle. I skipped the car for this trip, looking
to save money on ferry fares.

I regretted that plan a *little* when I reached the island and noticed
that [route
118](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules-maps/118-119.aspx)
only runs every hour and a half on Saturdays. No problem. I decided to
walk until I reached something interesting. Lovely roads to drive on.
Walking, maybe not so much. There was no sidewalk until I reached
downtown Vashon about an hour after leaving the ferry terminal.
Fortunately drivers were considerate as I negotiated the road shoulder
on foot.

Found a grocery store in downtown Vashon and recharged with a snack
while enjoying local art.

The park itself was only about five minutes' walk from the store.

## My Path

![map](map.jpg "The trails I covered, more or less")

The trails have names, but there were fewer signs than I would have
liked. Given the large number of trails to choose from, I set my plan as
"when in doubt, turn right." That kept me on the outer edge of the park.
About halfway through I had a better feel for the park layout, and made
more deliberate choices about my path.

## The Park Itself

![Mossy trees and undergrowth](mossy-trees.jpg)

This is a second-growth forest, moving from single-species tree
plantations to a more diverse selection that provides better homes for
wildlife and native growth. Trees provide pleasant shade throughout most
of the park, which is good news for some of my friends who are sensitive
to heat and sunlight.

Watch your step, though. You share these trails with horse riders, and
droppings are a minor hazard underfoot.

I visited in the tail end of summer. As lovely as Mukai and Meadowlake
ponds were, you could tell they were ready for rain. Still — there was
something in Mukai Pond big enough to make a splash when I got too
close.

Folks sometimes accuse me of getting lost in the weeds, getting so
wrapped up in details that I miss the big picture. They have a point. I
could stand to step back and look at the forest occasionally instead of
the trees.

![Look! Fungus!](fungus.jpg)

That said, these woods offered a wealth of details to keep my attention.

I picked Meadowlake Pond as the end of my circuit, enjoying the view and
the strange calls of the local ravens that were having a grand time in
the wetlands. Maybe the calls weren’t strange for ravens. I’m accustomed
to crows. These corvids definitely had a range of noises to make, from a
"Mwa\!" that sounded like a strange cat to vaguely simian noises to a
water drop sound.

## The Aftermath

I timed my return from downtown Vashon a little more carefully, catching
the 118 bus to the ferry terminal. Much better.

I put my Fitbit back on for the day — I’ve been taking a little vacation
from it the last week or so to minimize distractions — and managed to
get myself some new badges:

- "Trail Shoe" for 30,000 steps in a day
- "Hiking Boot" for 35,000 steps in a day
- "Skyscraper" for 100 floors in a day

16,000 or so of those steps were in the park itself, and pretty much all
of those "floors." It’s hardly mountain climbing, but there plenty of
hills to cover. Anyways, back to my Fitbit vacation. My feet hurt and I
won’t walk more than I must for the next couple days.

I enjoyed Island Center Forest, and particularly enjoyed getting out of
Seattle for a day. I’m already deciding which park to make a day trip
out of next time I feel the need to go [sauntering](/tags/sauntering).
