I knitted a pair of the fingerless Beer Gloves from [Son of Stitch 'n Bitch][]. This involved a couple new
techniques and several new mistakes.

These gloves have a nice cable along the back. A seed stitch patch near the palm supposedly helps with
opening bottles. I have not tested them for opening bottles yet, but the texture feels nice and gives a bit
more grip than the reverse stockinette alone.

The pattern called for double-pointed needles. I tried something new instead, and knit this using the [magic
loop][] method with a single circular needle. It worked well until the thumbs and fingers. It's kind of easy
to get yourself going in the wrong direction if you aren't careful. I accidentally knit one thumb pointing
almost straight out, instead of the slight angle of its mate.

Since my purl gauge tends to be loose, the reverse stockinette that dominates this pattern produced a bulkier
glove than I would have liked. If I make these again with the same [Impeccable Solids][] yarn, I should use
slightly smaller needle than the pattern calls for. And I probably won't use magic loop, either.

The [invisible ribbed bind off][] took me a few tries to get right. Fortunately, I had ten opportunities to
learn. Even more fortunately, the recipient of these gloves finds the loose yarn loops of failure to be
charming.

Enough nitpicking! These are good gloves. They keep their wearer warm while keeping fingers free for fine
motor skills. The cable is gorgeous. These are destined for a friend, who already loves them and will wear
them enthusiastically once the weather gets cold enough.

## What next?

I enjoyed making these, but I want to learn more about glove construction in general instead of haphazardly
implementing cool-looking patterns. I have several simple mitten and glove ideas planned!
