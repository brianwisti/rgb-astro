A short post noting Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts for virtual desktops
<!--more-->

I started spending more time in Windows recently for a change of pace. One feature in Windows 10 that pleases me is the [virtual desktop][], a way of keeping your applications in different visual spaces. Virtual desktops have been a fixture of life in my Linux and macOS for many years. It's great to see them in Windows!

Except I live for keyboard shortcuts, and haven't memorized the shortcuts for virtual desktops in Windows. That is the entire point of this post, so here they are:

Keys                     | Action
-------------------------|--------------------------------------
`Win` - `Tab`            | Open Task view, which shows desktops
`Win` - `Control` - `d`  | Create and switch to a new desktop
`Win` - `Control` - `←`  | Switch to previous desktop
`Win` - `Control` - `→`  | Switch to next desktop
`Win` - `Control` - `F4` | Close current desktop

This [Microsoft help page][] had all the info I need and more.
