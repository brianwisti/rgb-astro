Ann Budd’s book [The Knitter’s Handy Book of
Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85015.Knitters_Handy_Book_Of_Patterns)
continues to teach me new techniques. This project is my second
iteration of her "Basic hat" template. The black [wool
hat](/post/2018/10/winter-hat-and-gloves/) I made a couple of weeks ago
was the first.

What’s the difference? The wool hat — and most of the hats I have
knitted until now — had a
[ribbed](https://www.dummies.com/crafts/knitting/knitting-stitches/how-to-rib-stitch/)
edge. Alternating knit and purl stitches create a section more elastic
than the body of the hat, so it hugs a bit closer to your head.

This hat uses a
[hemmed](http://www.vogueknitting.com/pattern_help/how-to/beyond_the_basics/hems)
edge. Stockinette rows get folded over and stitched into the body of the
hat. I like the smooth look a hemmed edge produces. The extra volume of
the hem provides the snugness needed to keep your hat on your head.

Oh\! This was also the first time I used my copy of [The Handknitter’s
Yarn
Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167139-the-handknitter-s-yarn-guide)\!
See, I had this mystery yarn in my stash. It was thick and
self-striping, but that’s all I knew. No idea about the material, or
what size needles I should be using. And let’s be honest, "thick yarn"
is more than a little subjective. Some people [knit with
rope](https://youtu.be/FKw-pjwaXz8), after all.

The Yarn Guide provides a reference of yarn textures and varieties,
focused on details that are important for hand knitters. Machine
knitters track somewhat different details. It includes nifty details
like how a particular yarn material feels, or how it should burn — wool
burns slow, acrylic goes up quick. It also describes [wraps per
inch](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/how-measure-wraps-inch-wpi)
for establishing the weight of your yarn. "Weight" here is not about
mass and gravity, but about expected gauge and needle size.

My 200 gram chunk of mystery self-striping yarn yielded eight and a half
wraps per inch. A snip burned *quick*. This suggested I had a bulky
acrylic, and should use size 13-15 (9-10mm) knitting needles.

Except I misread those numbers — three cheers for minor cognitive
issues\! — and ended up using size 9 (5.5mm) needles. Combine that with
the fact that my flat knitting — such as what I used for the gauge
swatch — produces a wildly different gauge from my knitting in the
round, and. Well.

I made a *lovely* hat. A hat that was maybe a little too snug for a
comfortable fit on my head.

  "The hat looks nice, but after a minute starts pinching my forehead")

That’s okay though. The hat fits a friend perfectly, and it’s heading
home with them as I type.

For future projects, I will make my flat stockinette stitch match my
round knitting gauge more closely. The main difference is in my purl
stitch, which is looser than my knit stitch unless I pay close
attention. When you knit in the round, purl stitches occur less often
than when flat. That’s why those projects have a tighter gauge and
tighter fit.

So far the hat I am knitting now has only a somewhat tighter gauge than
the flat swatch. I *could* — maybe "should?" — also knit my gauge swatch
in the round, but I’m not entirely confident that a gauge tube is what I
need. We’ll see. But so far the current hat is the size I expected.
That’s good enough for me.
