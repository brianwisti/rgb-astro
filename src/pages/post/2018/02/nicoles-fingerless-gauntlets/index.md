Still catching up with the backlog of finished knitting. Finished these a couple weeks ago.

Like [Rainy's Mish-Mash Gloves][], these started from a fingerless gauntlet pattern in Sally Melville's [The
Knitting Experience Book 2: The Purl Stitch][]. I stayed closer to the original pattern this time, only adding
a couple of stripes.

Impressively, I also managed to stay close to the recommended gauge. How? Went a size up on the needles. I
tend to knit tight when working in the round. I used that tendency to my advantage in the next project, which
I'll post about shortly.
