Today I explored [Fauntleroy Park](http://fauntleroywatershed.org/), a
28 acre park in West Seattle with some nice trails.

Years ago, I had a regular habit of exploring local parks and trails.
Not *hiking*, mind you. Ugh. That sounds too purposeful for a person
like me. No, [sauntering](/tags/sauntering). I just wanted to wander
around, seeing what interests me, and enjoying the little differences
each park offered.

You know what? It’s past time to start that habit back up.

Fauntleroy Park is smaller than nearby [Lincoln
Park](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lincoln-park), but I wanted
someplace new to me.

I enjoyed following the park’s trails. Green, lush, and very local.

everywhere\! It left me feeling a bit nostalgic for the [green
belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_belt) that have been steadily
disappearing from the Pacific Northwest as we make room for more people.

The city is unavoidable. I could hear traffic at every point in the
park. I found myself accidentally outside the park a few times in my
brief visit. If you’re not careful some of the smaller trails will lead
you to someone’s back yard. That makes me even more impressed by how
much work has gone into maintaining the watershed in the middle of a
busy city’s residential neighborhoods. Volunteers and students maintain
the space, keeping it safe for salmon spawning, barred owls, and other
critters.

And if you give nature half a chance, things start growing absolutely
any place they can.

Still – I think next time I may want to venture a little further out.
Seattle has many parks and trails, but I have visited the longer trails
within the city many times over the years. The [Washington Trails
Association](https://www.wta.org/) provides resources for the aspiring
saunterer, including an [interactive
map](https://www.wta.org/go-outside/map) of trails across Washington
State.
