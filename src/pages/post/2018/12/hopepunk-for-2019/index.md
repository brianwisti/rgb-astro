Writing these late night thoughts is as close as I get to making resolutions.
<!--more-->

Lots of copying and pasting in this, since getting the words in full is important to me.

Tonight on Facebook, a friend shared a [Tumblr post][].

[Tumblr post]: http://heartlessharless.tumblr.com/post/133490414240/alycs-being-unconditionally-polite-kind-and

> hufflepunk

This has been my own general philosophy. Best to make it explicit. Values fade if kept in the shadows.

Anyways, "hufflepunk" sounds an awful lot like [hopepunk][].

There's more, but I don't need to paste the *entire* post.

Looking up Hopepunk led me to [this Vox article][], which does a fine job breaking it down so I don't have to.

[this Vox article]: https://www.vox.com/2018/12/27/18137571/what-is-hopepunk-noblebright-grimdark

> Through this framing, the idea of choosing hope becomes both an existential act that affirms your humanity,

Let's see, what other examples can I think of? Oh, I know: Mister Rogers. You could throw a dart at a wall of
Fred Rogers quotes and anything it hit would be appropriate for hopepunk. The man fully understood the world
he was speaking to.

[Mister Rogers]: http://www.pbs.org/parents/rogers

> Some days, doing "the best we can" may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn't
> perfect on any front — and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or
> anyone else. — [Fred Rogers](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/895495)

The thing about all of these is that you don't expect the world to magically become a better place through
your efforts. You do them because that's how things should be, and if we see someone stubbornly refusing to
submit to cynicism, it might give us a little strength for our own efforts. If nothing else, we can sleep a little
more easily with ourselves at night.

So I intend to be more explicitly this in 2019.

And — you know. If you don't like it, fuck off. I love you anyways.
