Scientists discovered Pluto had a moon when I was six years old. This is
what they had to work with.

All sorts of adults wondered what discoveries I could look forward to by
the time I was their age. No idea how old they were. I was a kid. They
were *ancient*. Let us say they were middle-aged.

I turned 43 in 2015 - statistically speaking, past the halfway point for
someone like me. So that makes me middle aged. What do Pluto and Charon
look like now?

Thanks to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov)'s [New
Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html)
we know what Pluto and Charon look like up close. NASA made us a nice
family montage photo.

But this Pluto picture blows my mind every time I look at it. We see ice
and mountains and an atmosphere. This is a *planet*!

Okay "dwarf planet." That blob on the outermost reach of my childhood
solar system is now a dwarf planet with moons, a landscape, and
thousands of Kuiper belt neighbors.

And that is just Pluto. So much amazing stuff has been discovered and
witnessed since my childhood.

I live across the street from a K-8 school. Some of those kids are about
six years old. I wonder what discoveries they will see by the time they
reach my age?
