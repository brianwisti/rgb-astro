They follow directions from Charlene Schurch’s [Sensational Knitted
Socks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399836.Sensational_Knitted_Socks)
with "Woven Stitch" as the repeating pattern. I used [Shoalwater Bay
Bamboo/Merino yarn](http://shoalwaterbayyarn.com/bamboo.html), which I
purchased a couple years ago at the Seattle University District Street
Fair.

That takes care of the technical details, more or less. What made this
project interesting enough to blog about?

I Kept a Journal
----------------

Knitting is detail work. You need to remember how many stitches you
knitted, how many more you need to knit, and how far along the increases
or decreases you are. I usually handle this by counting stitches
constantly, getting bored, and loathing the fact that people have two
feet because it means I need to knit a *second* sock. I often take
months to finish a single pair of socks. Knitting two at the same time
just confused me more — though I plan to tackle that eventually.

I decided to log my work with the Amicable Socks. Part of that involved
breaking down the generalized instructions into something specific for
my chosen pattern.

I also marked off rows as I finished them. I pondered tracking
individual stitches, but realized that would result in too much detail
to be useful.

These socks took me six weeks to finish, significantly beating my
previous record of 3 months. And that was with a week and a half of idle
time while I worried about whether I had enough yarn to finish the pair.

Oh, about that.

I Weighed My Yarn
-----------------

[@vmbrasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur) suggested that I weigh my
in-progress sock and the amount of remaining yarn, then compare the two
weights.

It turns out I had plenty of yarn to finish the project. This knowledge
kept me moving at a steady pace even when the yarn ball got alarmingly
small.

I Blocked Them When I Was Done
------------------------------

Every knitting book I read tells me to block my projects, but I never
did. These socks were special, though. I decided to block them.

![finished socks on sock hangers](amicable-socks-blocked.jpg "The important thing is the blocking, not me going crazy with filters.")

The result amazed me. The stitch pattern pops out. The yarn feels soft
and luxurious to the touch. The socks lay flat. I plan to block all of
my future projects.

What Next?
----------

Next I’m going to try something else new to me. I will make socks for
myself. Never did that before. I’ll log. I’ll block. If I get nervous,
I’ll weigh.
