I enjoyed importing the [coolnamehere](/categories/coolnamehere/)
content so much last weekend that I decided to import the posts froma
neglected [Blogspot](/categories/blogspot/) blog this weekend.
[jekyll-import](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/) simplified the
actual import process, though I still had a lot of manual cleanup to
perform.

The footer now includes links to *All Categories* and *All Posts*. The
main category listing in the header was pared back down to the stuff I
expect to update. I need to do something with the full post listing. It
is unwieldy now. Time to look up Jekyll plugins.

I don’t know what to do with the material still hosted on Blogspot. Do I
delete it? Do I make each post redirect here? I’ll figure it out.

<aside class="admonition">

I looked at the number of visitors to that blog since 2006 — not many —
and opted to delete it rather than spend any time messing with
redirects.

Why do this in the first place? I got bored of having pages I wrote more
or less for myself being scattered here, there, and everywhere. It’s a
little easier to remember what I’ve learned if I keep it in one place.

I also have my old LiveJournal posts, but they may end up staying
offline. They lack programming content and serve mainly as an insight
into how profoundly depressed I was up to about 2009 or so. Not
*especially* excited about reviewing that content at the moment.
