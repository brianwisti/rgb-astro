Not my first socks ever, of course. But there are many firsts in these socks.
<!--more-->

* They're mine! The rest have been for other people.
* toe-up
* [Judy's Magic cast-on][]
* short-row heels
* two different yarns (a black yarn and a self-striping brown, both 4-ply wool/poly by Regia)

Mistakes were made. I'm not sure whether it was due to gauge issues or bad
math, but toe and heel ended up pointy. So these socks feel a little long
when I wear them. Still nice if I don't wear them jogging. Lessons learned.

These semed to go faster than top-down socks with heel flaps.

I think my second pair will be simpler. Maybe just one type of yarn.
