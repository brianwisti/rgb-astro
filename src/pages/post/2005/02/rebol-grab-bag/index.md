[tutorial]: /post/2004/12/rebol-babysteps/
[top REBOL section]: /tags/rebol
[Moderately Interesting Ruby Exercises]: /post/2004/09/the-mires

This section contains articles on various random ideas that I had as I was learning REBOL.
They didnâ€™t really fit in the context of the [tutorial][] or any of the general pages in the [top REBOL section][].
I suppose they are counterparts to the [Moderately Interesting Ruby Exercises][] more than anything else.
I hope they provide some general ideas and inspiration for other potential REBOLlers.
