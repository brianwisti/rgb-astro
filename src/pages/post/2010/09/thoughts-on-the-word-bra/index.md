No, not the bra that provides appreciated support to countless women
around the world.

I have been thinking about the slang word "bra," which I already know is
short for "brother" and used pretty much the same way I, as a West coast
slacker, would use the word "dude." First of all, I think it is a cool
word and I would use it all the time if it didn’t sound so affected
coming out of my lips. Second, where the heck did it start?

The first time I heard the word "bra" was watching [Dog the Bounty
Hunter](http://www.dogthebountyhunter.com) a couple of years ago. Why
are you looking at me like that? I enjoy cheesy, semi-moralistic
entertainment as much as the next guy. I figured "bra" was Hawaiian
surfer slang and didn’t think much more about the word’s origin.

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

My TV close captioning and a couple of readers point out that the
spelling for the Hawaiian version is "brah." I’m on a roll, though.

</aside>

Last year I heard the term again, listening to [Ob La Di Ob La
Da](https://song.link/i/1441133613) by [The
Beatles](http://www.beatles.com).

![Pause for music](beatles-white-album.png "Pause for music")

I hadn’t listened to the song since before my exposure to Pacific Island
bounty hunters, but this time the chorus jumped out at me:

>     Ob-la-di, ob-la-da,
>     Life goes on, bra

Of course I missed it before. It was just one more nonsense word in a
chorus consisting almost entirely of nonsense words. But now I am
thinking of it as a word and there are a few things I’m suddenly driven
to do.

- Make sure that they really are singing "bra" and not something else.
- Find out where this usage started\!

It was easy to confirm the lyrics. A few seconds at Google took me to
[Steve’s Beatle
Page](http://www.stevesbeatles.com/songs/ob_la_di_ob_la_da.asp), which
provided lyrics. The page also had some notes about the recording
itself, like the fact that it was recorded in July of 1968. That is
useful information. The earliest usage I’ve found so far is 1968, if I
make the reasonable assumption that the Beatles meant "bra" the way I
think they meant "bra." It makes a little more sense than it being a
nonsense word, and a lot more sense than the idea that they suddenly
start blurting out the names of women’s undergarments like Jeff from
[Coupling](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237123).

Let’s see if [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra) can provide
anything useful.

> "Bra", slang for [Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother).

So … no. Wikipedia is not going to be helpful this time. Oh well, I
wouldn’t have trusted the drunken wiki monkeys if they did have more
information on the subject. [Google is having trouble,
too.](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:bra) The more common usage
of "bra" refers to a breast support contraption, but I’m not worried
about finding what I need to know. This will just take a couple of extra
minutes to dig deeper into the Internet hive mind.

I thought I’d give [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) a
try, but it’s worse than useless. One definition that esepcially bugs me
is trying to tell me that "bra" is just like "bro" but pronounced
different. No kidding. But *why* is it pronounced different? That
curiosity is what’s driving my little search. The entry does have a
grainy picture of an attractive bosom in a lovely pink brassiere, so I
guess it wasn’t a complete waste.

Let’s go back to Google, this time looking for "bra slang brother".
South African slang is referred to a few times. This looks promising.

> *bru* - male friend (shortening of *broer* meaning brother, see also
> *bra* below); compare [American
> English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English): "dude"
>
> *brah* - male friend (shortening of *brother*, se also *bru* above)

These were on the Wikipedia entry for [African slang
words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_African_slang_words) -
maybe the drunken wiki monkeys could link from the bra disambiguation
page to the South African slang page. The exact list is on a few other
sites, but I can’t tell who is plagiarizing who.

I see that somebody else is on a similar quest, judging by a post on the
[wordreference.com
forums](http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=481406). One of
the posters there believes that the word is Hawaiian surfer slang that
couldn’t have existed in 1967 — or 1968, as my info has shown me — or
that Paul McCartney would not have been familiar with it if it did
exist. I don’t think I agree with either assumption. Even if it was
nothing more than Hawaiian surfer slang, it could have had its origins a
long time ago. After all, [Hawaii](http://www.coffeetimes.com/surf.htm)
has been home to surfers for centuries, and to casual surfers since
1905. And the Beatles didn’t exactly spend all their days locked up in a
Liverpool basement.

The "broer" link is really tickling my curiosity. The [BBC
h2g2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4351402) is willing to put its foot
down and say firmly that "bra" derives from the Afrikaans word "broer"
and had its first usage in Cape Town. I love listening to people
speaking Afrikaans or Dutch. So many of the words are similar to their
English equivalents that my brain gets very frustrated that it can’t
understand what is being said. Listening to Dutch as an English speaker
is fairly similar to listening to English after you’ve had a night of
intensely heavy drinking. You know the words - or you think you know the
words - you just can’t make sense of what anyone is saying.

A [listing of South African
slang](https://web.archive.org/web/20071212030749/http://www.wavescape.co.za/bot_bar/surfrikan/slang.html)
suggests that the rolled "r" at the end of "broer" is too hard for lazy
English speakers, and that’s how it got shortened to "bru" and "bra." I
can believe that. You should hear my attempts at speaking Spanish
sometime. So at this point it looks like usage of "bra" as equivalent to
"bro" or "dude" may have from somewhere in the area of Cape Town, South
Africa. Or perhaps not.

What about that Beatles song? Well, this one should have been obvious to
me from the start. Paul McCartney was grooving on the reggae\! Jamaican
[Desmond Dekker](http://www.desmonddekker.com/), considered by some to
be the first reggae star, had recently released singles in England —
[007 (Shanty Town)](https://song.link/i/1147768992) in 1967, and
[Israelites](https://song.link/i/1147769697) in 1968 (although the hit
version wasn’t released until 1969). There was at least one popular
reggae track floating around in the ether while Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da was
being written. In fact, the Desmond referred to in the song is none
other than Desmond Dekker. I highly recommend listening to Dekker’s
"King of Ska" if you can find the track. It is good stuff, and you can
hear the influence he had on … pretty much every ska or reggae song
that came after.

"Bra" is Jamaican slang for "brother," according to the Dictionary of
Jamaican English. It was first recorded in that form in 1943, which of
course means that it could have been widespread in Jamaican slang by
1967-1968. Interestingly enough, "bra" is a shortened form of the
Jamaican slang "bro’er" from 1907. "Bro’er" looks a lot like "broer",
but it apparently doesn’t have the same roots. Remember what I was
saying before about Dutch/Afrikaans and English? I think this is a good
example.

"Bro’er" might sound more familiar to Americans as "Brer," as in [Brer
Rabbit](http://www.americanfolklore.net/brer-rabbit.html). Brer Rabbit
was the source of my favorite underdog stories as a small child. Oh.
I’ve been pronouncing "Brer" wrong my whole life. First off, it’s
supposed to be a shortened form of the English word "brother," with the
ending "er" sound softened dramatically — a Southern thing, I think. You
end up with something sounding more like "Bruh Rabbit." "Bra" may in
fact have split origins: one thread coming from the Southern US and
Jamaica, and the other coming from South Africa.

The drunken monkeys [tell
us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit) that the "Brer" in Brer
Rabbit’s name came about due to a custom in many African cultures of
people referring to each other as "brother." I’m too tired now to verify
this — which may be the ultimate source of Wikipedia’s power — but it’s
a piece of trivia that amuses me. The character Desmond (probably not
named after the King of Ska) in the show
[Lost](http://www.losttvshow.org) (filmed in Hawaii, home state of that
endearingly scruffy bounty hunter of basic cable who says "bra" all the
time) also has a habit of addressing everybody as "brother". I love
random connections.

I think that’s enough time spent exploring the origins of a single
random slang term.
