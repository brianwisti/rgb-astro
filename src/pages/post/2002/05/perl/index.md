What can I say about Perl? I’ve had very little to talk about it on this
site over the years, despite the fact that I use Perl on an almost daily
basis. It’s not as cute as [Ruby](/tags/ruby/), or as clean as
[Python](/tags/python/), but it’s always there. There have been numerous
projects that are just plain easier in Perl. I can’t explain it.

## Interesting Perl Sites

There are lots of excellent Perl sites out there. You can prove it for
yourself by checking in your favorite Web search site. I’ve decided to
list my favorites below, though. It’s a bit easier than digging through
the directory.

  - [perl.org](http://perl.org/) is the defacto home page for Perl on
    the Web.

  - [perlmonks](http://perlmonks.org/) is the place to ask questions.

  - [use.perl.org](http://use.perl.org/) and
    [Perlbuzz](http://perlbuzz.com) are the places to go for the latest
    news about Perl.
