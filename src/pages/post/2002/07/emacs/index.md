![GNU Emacs](emacs-logo.png)

Yep. [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs), one of the shining
stars of the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org) project and its
[philosophy](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) of Free
software. It’s sort of an editor, but if all you do is edit files with
it, maybe you could be using something else. I am rather fond of
[NEdit](http://www.nedit.org/) and [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/). I am
also a longtime user of [Vim](/tags/vim) — despite my occasional
membership in the [Church of
Emacs](http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/religion/). There are a lot of fine
editors out there, and you will be quite productive working with any of
them. The alternatives I mentioned are customizable and scriptable, but
Emacs is more than that. What is it, exactly? Well, let’s ask Emacs
itself:

> Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
> display editor.

That quote comes from GNU `info`, the built-in documentation system for
GNU Emacs and most of the other applications in the GNU project. Oh, one
more thing: I am going to stop saying "GNU" all the time. Just assume
that I am referring to GNU software in the Emacs section of the site
unless otherwise specified. Now, back to my babbling about Emacs,
already in progress.

I want you to know about Emacs and give it a try. I can imagine you
might be curious about what I’m doing with it that’s easier than doing
things another way. Well, things are not so much *easier* under Emacs as
they are a bit more streamlined. Nearly everything I do is contained in
the Emacs environment, with a lot of the pretty sparkles and
distractions cut away. It’s not for everybody. See, I like to make
pretty things for other people. I’m not as concerned that the stuff I
use is pretty. It’s more important to me that it’s easy for me to get to
what I need without breaking up my train of thought.

Okay, so what are the main tasks I use Emacs for?

- Editing text files of course, including but not limited to:
    - Notes
    - Source code for Ruby, Perl, C++, and LISP projects
- Email, using the vm module
- Reading documentation with info
- The scratch buffer also makes a handy calculator, since it can
  evaluate LISP code.

My main advice to you if you want to use Emacs: do more than just edit
text with it. Use it as a calculator. Let it handle your email. Play
Tetris with it. Experiment and have a little fun.

What’s that? "Play Tetris with it?" Yes, that’s right. I said "Tetris".
`M-x tetris` and see for yourself.
