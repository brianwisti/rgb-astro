I say that I do not have a favorite programming language. If I did have
a favorite language, it might be [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/). I’ve
been messing around with it randomly for a few years, and I am
continually amazed by how easy it is to build programs with it. Ruby is
a delight to work with. I’m not sure how to describe it, because it uses
elements from so many great languages. Freak that I am, I’ve gone out
and started fiddling with some of the languages that Ruby borrows from
so I can use Ruby better.

Ruby is Object Oriented in a way that languages like
[Java](http://java.sun.com/) claim to be, but without as many special
conditions. It operates on The Principle Of Least Surprise, which
basically means that code does what it looks like it’s supposed to, with
a minimum of surprises or clever tricks.

## Ruby Links

- The [Standard Library
  Documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/) contains up-to-date
  reference material for all of the library modules that come with
  Ruby. It’s a work in progress, but pretty impressive.
- It would be silly to forget about [the Ruby home
  page](http://www.ruby-lang.org/). You’ll find pretty much everything
  you expect at a home page, including downloads, mailing list links,
  and links to more information.
- The [Seattle.rb](http://www.zenspider.com/seattle.rb) is a small but
  dedicated group of Ruby hackers who always have some crazy idea
  about new projects. They officially meet once a month, but the
  curious are welcome to come hang out for general geekery every
  Tuesday.
- I have to toot my own horn a little. I’ve got a
  [tutorial](/post/2003/06/ruby-babysteps-01-first-steps/) page on
  this site, and the total novice might find it useful. The
  experienced Ruby hacker is encouraged to scan it and suggest
  improvements.
