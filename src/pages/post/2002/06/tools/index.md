I already talk a little bit on this site about the language tools I use,
such as [Perl](/tags/perl/), [Ruby](/tags/ruby/), and
[Python](/tags/python/). Thereâ€™s a section where I touch on the most
important tool of a geek like me: the [text editor](/tags/editors/).

But coolnamehere needs a section for the smaller tools that I use
everyday. They may have been born on UNIX-like operating systems, but
they do not live *exclusively* in that environment. They may have been
written in a particular language, but that is not what makes them
interesting.

As with every other section on this site, the stuff in here is useful to
me, and new pages will get added roughly whenever I get an idea in the
middle of the night. It is rather hard to predict. Will it ever be
useful to you? I hope so. Will it be useful to me? Probably. I forget
things if I do not type them down somewhere.
