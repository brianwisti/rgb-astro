<aside class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Update</p>

2020-04-28
: Stuff has happened since I last edited this page in 2009. I know
  folks bounce in here occasionally from search engines, so here’s
  more up to date information for you.

  - Making Emacs more like Vim can be done with
    [evil-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) or
    [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/).
  - Try [vim-spf13](http://vim.spf13.com/) for a fully-loaded Vim
    experience.
  - Plugins are available to emulate Vim in most editors now. They
    cover the bits used most by most people, but experienced users
    will notice gaps.

</aside>

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is one of the two major editors of the UNIX
world. The other one is [Emacs](/tags/emacs/), which I am also quite
fond of. Still, it’s hard to beat Vim. It may be awkward, ugly, and hard
to use, but there’s just something inescapable about it. Regular
expressions are a major part of the editing interface, which gives you a
great deal of (admittedly cryptic) power.

Emacs and Vim get equal time in my work. I probably shouldn’t admit that
in a public forum, since a statement like that is nearly considered
blasphemous by devotees of each application. Emacs has a lot of power as
an environment, but I still find Vim to be the more powerful *editor*.
So which one I’ll use depends on the scope of my work that day. It will
be Emacs if I need to do remote editing, email checking, project
management, and other such tasks which are not specifically editing.
However, the choice will be Vim if I just want to sit down and bang some
code out in quick order with minimal distractions. Make your own choice,
and have fun with it. And remember, you can use `viper-mode` if all
you’re looking for is vi-style finger movement.

Ages ago, I had my own copy of the online Vim documentation on the site.
It was a simple affair, and was intended to provide some filler for the
site. Show I could do text formatting, stuff like that. The problem is
that it takes up so much space on my Web host. You’re probably best off
using the official documentation at the [VimDoc](http://vimdoc.sf.net)
site.

## Cream

I recently discovered [Cream](http://cream.sf.net/), a heavily
customized release of Vim intended to provide all the power of Vim
without the headache of learning about Command Mode or anything like
that. Try Cream if you are interested in getting an easy-to-use version
of one incredibly powerful editor.
