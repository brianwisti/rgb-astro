Got sidetracked while picking up breakfast stuff from [Uwajimaya][]. Should probably have finished my first
cup of coffee before I left. Could have been worse. There was an entire boy band worth of that Babinski Cold
Brew. I only took one.

Meanwhile, someone put a flyer on the apartment bulletin board for the [Earshot Jazz Festival][]. Checked to
see if any of the names were familiar. Most were new to me, but I recognized  --- and enjoy --- [Knife Knights][].

A jazz context makes more sense for Knife Knights than rap/hip-hop, which is where I usually see them filed.
Heck, genres are meaningless anyways. My favorite music stores just arrange albums alphabetically.

Anyways, time to drink some coffee!
