Having written a few glue tasks with [GNU Coreutils][] and some shell scripts,
I agree with that point. Even just glueing together Coreutils can be easier
with [Perl][].

And [Perl 6][]:

I won't say whether I installed a fresh build of [Rakudo][] and played
around with [Perl 6][] after listening to the podcast, but â€” I installed a fresh
build of Rakudo and played around with Perl 6 after listening to this episode.
