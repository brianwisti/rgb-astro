I'm done with zombie movies.  *watches trailer* ok I'm not quite done.

Reminds me of [Shaun of the Dead][shaun-of-the-dead]. Not in any specific
notes, just the slapstick gore and "what sort of hero could a (slacker,
kindergarden teacher) be?" angle.

(red band, so gory. Also, it's a kindergarden teacher protecting kids
during an outbreak so maybe don't watch if that's a thing for you)

For some reason I couldn't embed the trailer anymore, but I can still link to
it: [Little Monsters][little-monsters]
