We watched the "Code" episode of Netflix's [explained][].There's only so much that can be covered in 24
minutes, but I enjoyed the high level overview of concepts, history, and issues they presented within their

One of many iconic snippets  -- I may do an explainer post if I don't find somebody else's first -- was from this 1999 interview of David Bowie. [Paleofuture][] posted a handy transcript
of the highlights.

That summarizes the last twenty years, from Netflix to Facebook to 4chan to FOSS to [30-50 Feral Hogs][] and
beyond.
