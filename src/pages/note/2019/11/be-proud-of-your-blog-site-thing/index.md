This [Brent Simmons][] post is going around a lot in my RSS feed. Probably because many of us feel similar --
or want to.

It took me a long time to admit that my site was a blog. I disliked the word and aspired to be more like the
sprawling mass of [Softpanorama][]. _Content_ not a mere stream of distractions. This was before [Twitter][], mind
you.

Eventually I settled down. Time is a factor for all content.

And if I was starting today I doubt Softpanorama would be my target. Maybe [CSS-Tricks][].

Yeah like I could ever be that focused.

I'm proud of my blog site thing. I've made friends through it. I've lost a couple. It's all over the place,
but very much represents the changes and consistencies in who I've been the last couple decades.

Start your own blog site thing if you haven't already. Have fun!
