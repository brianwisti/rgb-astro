Twenty years ago -- give or take a couple weeks -- I started working as a backend programmer [in tech][] for a
real live paycheck, as opposed to [designing sites][] for cigarette money from [local ISPs][].

[local ISPs]: http://l7.net/

About six months later the outer layers of the [dot-com bubble][] frayed and I
experienced my first layoff. Couple recessions and a few mental breakdowns later, I'm still at it!

I have no deep thoughts on the subject. I still like writing code, even when I hate it. I also enjoy eating.
Being a programmer has made both these things easier.
