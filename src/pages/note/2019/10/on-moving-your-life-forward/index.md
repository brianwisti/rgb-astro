Even with [Taskwarrior][] to help me tackle my TODO list, I feel the pain of living "paycheck
to paycheck":

[Taskwarrior]: /tags/taskwarrior

I have the numbers to show that I'm getting lots done. Somehow I feel like I'm treading water. There's always
more. Both the great ideas and the big goals grow stale as I address the urgent issues that must be done
*now*.

What is the recommendation to get out of that loop?

Okay, I can do that. Well, sort of. I'm still trying to build some kind of idea what "forward" means for me.
However, I *can* make a point of completing one task a week that's been pushed aside by the high-[priority][],
immediately-[due][] attention grabbers at the top of `task next`.
