Here's an interesting correlation.

> In general, the slower walkers tended to show signs of "accelerated ageing" with their lungs, teeth and
> immune systems in worse shape than those who walked faster.
>
> The more unexpected finding was that brain scans showed the slower walkers were more likely to have
> older-looking brains too.

As a fast walker who gets stuck behind slow walkers on the way to work, I endorse these findings.
