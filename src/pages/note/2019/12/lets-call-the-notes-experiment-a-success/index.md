Yep. I love the [Notes](/note) experiment. It encourages me to post
quick thoughts frequently.

Iâ€™m officially assimilating [Notes](/note) into the main flow of the
site. That means [tags](/tags) instead of their own taxonomy. It also
means they get listed with posts in the [archive](/archive).

Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and
history we are back to one main flow.
