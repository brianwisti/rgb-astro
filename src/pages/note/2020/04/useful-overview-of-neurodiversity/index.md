> A lot of the work in neurodiversity now seems to be suggesting that grouping
traits together and circling that and calling it a thing isn’t the best way to
reason about this. Insurance companies really love it.

Neurodiversity provides an alternate take on traits that are common to
ADHD, autism, OCD, and others. Myk’s talk summarizes them better than I
could, and better than resources I could find for linking.

The talk lasts half an hour including questions. Some occasional audio
issues thanks to everyone’s new remote life, but the transcript makes
following easier.

Some new / clarified bits for me — aside from the above quote:

- many folks experience these traits, but their intensity for
  neurodivergent folks is such that we must plan our lives around them
- useful medical information is not widely available
- "dead time" oh god that thing where your brain won’t let you do
  something now because you’re planning to do something later
- description of "autistic burnout" sounds like something I’m going
  through right now
