Found this in my image folder the other day. It’s from working through
[Mark Kistler](https://markkistler.com/)'s book *You can Draw in 30
Days* last year. I like it. Sure I kinda already know I can draw. But
it’s good to refresh yourself every so often.

Oh, and I used [Max Ulichney](https://maxulichney.com/)'s
[MaxPack](https://gumroad.com/maxulichney) brush sets for
[Procreate](https://procreate.art/). The Gouache pack for sure, and
probably others.
