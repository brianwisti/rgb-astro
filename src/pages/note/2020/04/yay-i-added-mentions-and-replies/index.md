Not real time, of course. It updates when I build the site. The layout
needs touching up. But all the details are there.

I used Max Böck’s [Webmentions
post](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/#webmentions)
as a starting point.

And yes, I’m far enough along with the Indieweb stuff that my study
notes would make a decent blog post. Maybe a couple.
