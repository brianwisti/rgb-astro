title: Wanted a uses page, made a config section

[uses]: https://genehack.org/uses/
[config]: /config
[Hugo]: /tags/hugo
[go-org]: https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org
[john sj anderson]: https://genehack.org

All jealous of [john sj anderson][]'s [uses][] page.
Started making my own.
Decided it would be easier just to share my [config][].
Might as well, since [Hugo][] directly supports org content via [go-org][].

I'll add `/uses` later.
Anyways, time for music.
