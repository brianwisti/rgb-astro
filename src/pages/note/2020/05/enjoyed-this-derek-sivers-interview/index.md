I'm not a money podcast person, but this episode was worth an hour of my time.
I found myself nodding along with this interview with [Derek Sivers][] --
who I already love for [`/now`][] pages and the [NowNowNow][] project.
His emphasis on making enough vs making all the billions meshes well with my preference for using the tech
you need vs emulating Google-scale solutions for *every* project.

I also enjoyed the shout-out to [Amy Hoy][].

No transcript, so I'll just quote the summary:
