[thoughts]: https://kevq.uk/my-thoughts-on-richard-stallmans-return-to-the-fsf-board/

Yeah this is about Stallman being back on the board of the FSF. Kev Quirk has
good [thoughts] about how it was communicated. Me, I'm tired. I had *just* been
thinking how some of my favorite people have been driven off the public Internet
via doxxing and harrassment.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll never stop being mad / sad about how tech treats its _why&#39;s and its serious ponies. <a href="https://t.co/Qd7nTnaTm7">https://t.co/Qd7nTnaTm7</a></p>&mdash; brian wisti (@brianwisti) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianwisti/status/1373506446768283652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And now Free Software's problematic fave -- one of many, to be honest -- is
back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility. Bah.

I'm not purging my system or anything, but I'm sure as hell done making a point
of using GNU tools. This affects the FSF not one bit. It's only me conserving my
energy for things I can care about.
