title: Look at me with one Asciidoctor page in an Astro site

[repo]: https://github.com/brianwisti/rgb-astro-adoc
[adoc]: https://asciidoctor.org
[astro]: https://astro.build

I wanted [Asciidoctor][adoc] in [Astro][astro].
It took some fiddling, but not as much as expected.
It's a good start.

I won't bore you with the details.
Maybe later when there are more details to bore you with.
If you want to look there's a [repo][repo].

Now for the other 600 pages.
