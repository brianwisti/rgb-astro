title: Try Riv if you like Vim and reStructuredText

[Riv]: https://github.com/gu-fan/riv.vim
[Deft for Emacs]: https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/
[Vim]: https://www.vim.org/
[reStructuredText]: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/

[Riv][] is a wiki, but feels like more of a notebook. Think [Deft for Emacs][]
with journaling and HTML publishing. What makes Riv interesting — aside from the
[Vim][] thing — is that it uses [reStructuredText][] for its native format.

It works well enough, especially once you build up muscle memory for Riv's
leader sequence <kbd>C-e</kbd>. Don't overload it right away though! It includes
some insert mode mappings, which can get real confusing if your preferred
leader is a space.

Meanwhile I got a lot of [neovim][] ideas. Course, I need to get some more
practice in with [pynvim][] first. And I suppose some more practice with Riv.
