title: Drawing and site shuffling are coping techniques
---

That says it all, really. Been a stressful oh I don't know let's say year and a
half or so.

[Picnic CSS]: https://picnicss.com/
[org-config]: /tag/org-config

Tweaked and reloaded the [Picnic CSS][]-based theme I had a while back. I missed
it. Buried my bookmarking links â€” they're still there for now, but I have
another idea how I want to handle the "info dump" section of the site. I'll
also revisit the [org-config][] section, since it still gets traffic even
though I buried it months ago.

[Linea Sketch]: https://linea-app.com/

And then there's the drawing. More hours, days, and weeks of manual symmetry
in [Linea Sketch][]. Got a store refresh planned for the art! That was what
sparked the site shuffling. Wanted a clean slate for my money-grubbing.
