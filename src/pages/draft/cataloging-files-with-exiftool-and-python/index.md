## Exiftool

We talked about that the other day.

It's Perl, but we can get at it from Python using PyEXifTool.

## SQLite

Don't think of it as a database.
Think of it as a really good cache.
Okay, it's a little bit of a database.

It supports JSON queries!

## Looking for common fields

- I can maybe use `rowid`.

    $ exiftool '~/Dropbox/Getting Started.pdf'

    ExifTool Version Number         : 11.85
    File Name                       : Getting Started.pdf
    Directory                       : /home/random/Dropbox
    File Size                       : 243 kB
    File Modification Date/Time     : 2015:02:17 09:36:41-08:00
    File Access Date/Time           : 2020:05:30 14:16:13-07:00
    File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2020:05:30 14:16:14-07:00
    File Permissions                : rw-r--r--
    File Type                       : PDF
    File Type Extension             : pdf
    MIME Type                       : application/pdf
    PDF Version                     : 1.7
    â‹®

Everything past `MIME Type` looks specific to the file I'm looking at.
So here's my idea.

## The Plan

### Create a SQLite Database

``` sql
CREATE TABLE file (
    FilePath TEXT unique,
    FileBytes INT,
    Directory,
    FileName,
    FileSize,
    MIMEType,
    FileType,
    FileTypeExtension,
    FileCreateDate,
    FileModifyDate,
    FileAccessDate,
    FilePermissions,
    Meta,
    ScanTime INT
);
```

### Populate it with Perl

Because ExifTool

### Explore it with SQLiteBrowser

``` sql
CREATE VIEW duplicate AS
SELECT a.*
FROM file a
join (
  SELECT FileBytes, MIMEType, count(*) AS FileCount
  FROM FILE
  GROUP BY FileBytes, MIMEType
  HAVING FileCount > 1
)
ON a.FileBytes = b.FileBytes
  AND a.MIMEType = b.MIMEType
order by a.FileBytes, a.FilePath;
```
